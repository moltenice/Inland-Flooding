# [Inland Flooding](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3541887879)

A streamlined version of Nerevatar’s excellent “Nere’s Inland Flooding and Climate Change” mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1690507099. This edition removes climate change mechanics so all that's done is that inland tiles can flood.

Recommended if you use other mods that change CO₂ emissions or climate, as Nere’s original version may cause conflicts.

I highly recommend also installing the excellent mod "Climate Balance - Complete Pack": https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1667883116 that slows down climate change and also makes flood barriers cost more but not scale by tiles, both of which this mod removes from Nerevatar's version.

Make sure you don't subscribe to “Nere’s Inland Flooding and Climate Change” mod and this one at the same time.

To get this working on Primordial maps, make sure you see Nerevatar's mod description.
