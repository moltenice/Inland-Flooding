# Inland-Flooding
A streamlined version of Nerevatar’s excellent “Nere’s Inland Flooding and Climate Change” mod—this edition removes climate change mechanics.

Recommended if you use other mods that change CO₂ emissions or climate, as Nere’s original version may cause conflicts.

I highly recommend also installing this excellent mod that slows down climate change and also makes flood barriers cost more but not scale by tiles, both of which this mod removes from Nerevatar's version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1667883116 (Climate Balance - Complete Pack).

All credit for the original concept to Nerevatar.
